 A fairly complete 6502/65C02 development environment with some sample computer
 configurations. Written entirely in Gambas.
 Using the JIT it runs at about simulated 4mhz. Not too bad!
 Added New Device:  MMU Memory Management unit.
 Added more help/ better error messages.
 Update to work with new Wait implementation.
 Update to include 65C02 instructions,xa assembler into ~/asm directory
 Updated fo fix exit in fmain, when stoping or stepping from debugger screen.
 Updated name to em6502, to Match github source
 I am continually amazed by the power and flexibility of Gambas3 Created by
 Benoît Minisini.
 Updated Device set with MMU memory management unit implementation
 Updated use the -d option to replace  your ~/6502 root directory content with
 latest information.
 Updated to provide cli interface example  '6502 -c Default' will start the
 default computer configuration.
 Updated to provide instruction level profiling, look under debug menu.
 Updated to improve device halt and cpu halt, added big reset button device.
 Improved the Basic device example.
 This was a little hobby project, and a lot of fun writing 6502 programs and
 getting some of the old tiny basic... yes more basic, running again. quite a
 few are included are part of the project.
 Have fun exploring the nostalgia of the  70's again...
 This requires the latest development copy of gambas, or 3.17 which ever comes
 first!
 Updated to better handle device, and user NMI,IRQ,RESET requests
 This program is written in Gambas.

 Add function to tiny basic, multi line : , read text char to Variable
 Cleanup Error handling and create verbosity switch to command line
 Fixed SEi instruction
 v1.1.6
 updated tiny basic to support IRQ handlers written in basic
 updated PIA device to support realtime clock and irq timer
 added sample programs for clock and irq handler implementation
 Fixed update/create of intial files... was failing on first time create of
 root(6502) directory
 Update Such that new devices and Computer Defs are created upon new release
 without having to do a -d to update everything.
 Added New Device:  MMU Memory Management unit.
 Added more help/ better error messages.
 Update to work with new Wait implementation.
 Update to include 65C02 instructions,xa assembler into ~/asm directory
 Updated fo fix exit in fmain, when stoping or stepping from debugger screen.
 Updated name to em6502, to Match github source
 I am continually amazed by the power and flexibility of Gambas3 Created by
 Benoît Minisini.
 Updated the Update process, More automatic
 Updated Device set with MMU memory management unit implementation
 Updated use the -d option to replace  your ~/6502 root directory content with
 latest information.
 Updated to provide cli interface example  '6502 -c Default' will start the
 default computer configuration.
 Updated to provide instruction level profiling, look under debug menu.
 Updated to improve device halt and cpu halt, added big reset button device.
 Improved the Basic device example.
 This was a little hobby project, and a lot of fun writing 6502 programs and
 getting some of the old tiny basic... yes more basic, running again. quite a
 few are included are part of the project.
 Have fun exploring the nostalgia of the  70's again...
 This requires the latest development copy of gambas, or 3.17 which ever comes
 first!

 A fairly complete 6502/65C02 development environment with some sample computer
 configurations. Written entirely in Gambas.
 Using the JIT it runs at about simulated 4mhz. Not too bad!
 The tiny basic included in this project will run on the kim1 or ct65, it
 supports, IRQ handlers written in Basic. It allows mutiple Tasks to be spawned
 in your basic program. More fun.
 V1.1.16

 V1.1.14
 Many bug fixes, spedd improvements, added Watch window
 TinyBasic is now Concurrent Basic, full ipc/task management
 V1.1.12
 Updated to multi task Basic language OS
 Improved em IDE to handle Upper lower case symbols correctly
 Numerous bug fixes
 V1.1.11
 Updated Memory mapping improves speed by 20%
 Update Tinybasic IL manages Tasks natively.
  Updated documentation for supported computer emulations
     and devices.

  Updated MYTB to tokenize and compile  line addresses... startrek, and
 adventure now work  great, have fun!
  mytb is 60% faster
 Added ability to debug 6502 apps using source code debugger, uses .lst file as
 the source file. May open as many files as binary apps loaded. Just double
 click the .sym entry on the screen.
 Added ability to debug using souce code listing, with multiple binary sources.

 root(6502) directory
 Update Such that new devices and Computer Defs are created upon new release
 without having to do a -d to update everything.
 Added New Device:  MMU Memory Management unit.
 Added more help/ better error messages.
 Update to work with new Wait implementation.
 Update to include 65C02 instructions,xa assembler into ~/asm directory
 Updated fo fix exit in fmain, when stoping or stepping from debugger screen.
 Updated name to em6502, to Match github source
 I am continually amazed by the power and flexibility of Gambas3 Created by
 Benoît Minisini.
 Updated the Update process, More automatic
 Updated Device set with MMU memory management unit implementation
 Updated use the -d option to replace  your ~/6502 root directory content with
 latest information.
 Updated to provide cli interface example  '6502 -c Default' will start the
 default computer configuration.
 Updated to provide instruction level profiling, look under debug menu.
 Updated to improve device halt and cpu halt, added big reset button device.
 Improved the Basic device example.
 This was a little hobby project, and a lot of fun writing 6502 programs and
 getting some of the old tiny basic... yes more basic, running again. quite a
 few are included are part of the project.
 Have fun exploring the nostalgia of the  70's again...
 This requires the latest development copy of gambas, or 3.17 which ever comes
 first!
 Updated to better handle device, and user NMI,IRQ,RESET requests
 This program is written in Gambas.

 Using the JIT it runs at about simulated 4mhz. Not too bad!
 Fix 6502 test and set bit instruction, added a tunnels and traps game
 Add function to tiny basic, multi line : , read text char to Variable
 Cleanup Error handling and create verbosity switch to command line
 Fixed SEi instruction

 Add function to tiny basic, multi line : , read text char to Variable
 Cleanup Error handling and create verbosity switch to command line
 Fixed SEi instruction
 v1.1.6
 updated tiny basic to support IRQ handlers written in basic
 updated PIA device to support realtime clock and irq timer
 added sample programs for clock and irq handler implementation
 Fixed update/create of intial files... was failing on first time create of
 root(6502) directory
 Update Such that new devices and Computer Defs are created upon new release
 without having to do a -d to update everything.
 Added New Device:  MMU Memory Management unit.
 Added more help/ better error messages.
 Update to work with new Wait implementation.
 Update to include 65C02 instructions,xa assembler into ~/asm directory
 Updated fo fix exit in fmain, when stoping or stepping from debugger screen.
 Updated name to em6502, to Match github source
 I am continually amazed by the power and flexibility of Gambas3 Created by
 Benoît Minisini.
 Updated the Update process, More automatic
 Updated Device set with MMU memory management unit implementation
 Updated use the -d option to replace  your ~/6502 root directory content with
 latest information.
 Updated to provide cli interface example  '6502 -c Default' will start the
 default computer configuration.
 Updated to provide instruction level profiling, look under debug menu.
 Updated to improve device halt and cpu halt, added big reset button device.
 Improved the Basic device example.
 This was a little hobby project, and a lot of fun writing 6502 programs and
 getting some of the old tiny basic... yes more basic, running again. quite a
 few are included are part of the project.
 Have fun exploring the nostalgia of the  70's again...
 This requires the latest development copy of gambas, or 3.17 which ever comes
 first!
 V1.1.8
 Updated to better handle device, and user NMI,IRQ,RESET requests
 This program is written in Gambas.
